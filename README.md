**date:** 2019-04-01

I am following [Real Python's](https://realpython.com) tutorial ["Get Started With Django Part 1: Build a Portfolio App"](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/). My hope is to be able to replace my SquareSpace website with oone built myself using Django.

I have finished the tutorial and will continue to use this project experimentally as a learning tool.
